# Insight
Insight is an AI-powered data analysis platform designed to help both technical and non-technical users analyze their data quickly and effectively.

## Key Features:
**Data Description**: Upon uploading a dataset, Insight provides an overview including the dataset title, a brief description, column names, data types, and row count, allowing users to quickly understand the structure of their data.

**Data Cleaning**: Insight automatically checks each column for common data issues such as missing values, outliers, inconsistent formatting, and more. It then suggests practical solutions for each problem (e.g., filling missing values with the mean or median, or removing outliers) and applies the fixes to ensure your dataset is clean and ready for analysis.

**Data Analysis**: Insight offers a powerful descriptive analysis tool where users can select two columns and get insightful summaries such as mean, median, standard deviation, and correlations, helping them uncover patterns and trends.

**Data Visualization**: allowing users to easily select columns and create visualizations that bring their data to life. Whether you’re creating bar charts, line graphs, or scatter plots, Insight empowers users to gain deeper insights into their data through customized visuals.

## How it works:
1. **Uploading Your Dataset**:
   - The user starts by uploading their dataset (in formats like CSV or Excel) into the platform through the simple upload interface.

2. **Data Description**:
   - Once the dataset is uploaded, Insight automatically generates a summary of the dataset. This includes:
     - **Title**: The name of the dataset.
     - **Brief Description**: A short summary or overview of the dataset’s purpose or contents.
     - **Column Information**: Lists all the columns in the dataset along with their data types (e.g., numeric, categorical) and the total number of rows.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Insight runs a **data cleaning check** for each column to identify any issues like:
     - Missing values
     - Inconsistent formatting
     - And so more!
   - After identifying any problems, it provides **suggestions** on how to fix them (e.g., filling missing values with the mean, median, or removing rows with outliers).
   - Users can choose how they’d like to fix these issues, and the platform applies these changes to the dataset.

4. **Descriptive Data Analysis**:
   - The user can then select two columns from the dataset to perform a **descriptive analysis**. Insight provides detailed statistical insights such as:
     - Mean, median, and mode
     - Standard deviation
     - Correlations (if applicable)

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Using the **Pygwalker** library, users can select the columns they want to visualize and generate different types of **interactive visualizations**, such as:
     - Bar charts
     - Line graphs
     - Scatter plots
     - Histograms
   - These visualizations help users better understand patterns, distributions, and relationships in their data.

6. **Download the Cleaned Dataset**:
   - After applying the data cleaning steps, users have the option to **download** the updated and cleaned dataset, ready for further analysis or reporting.
