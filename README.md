# InsightðŸ“Š
Insight is an AI-powered data analysis platform designed to help both technical and non-technical users analyze their data quickly and effectively.

## Key Features:

- **Data Description**: Provides a quick overview of the dataset, including title, description, column names, data types, and row count.

- **Data Cleaning**: Automatically checks for issues like missing values and outliers, offering solutions to fix them and clean the data.

- **Data Analysis**: Allows users to select two columns for descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, correlations) to uncover patterns.

- **Data Visualization**: Enables easy creation of visualizations (bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots) to gain deeper insights into the data.


## How it works:
1. **Uploading Your Dataset**:
   - The user starts by uploading their dataset (in formats like CSV or Excel) into the platform through the simple upload interface.

2. **Data Description**:
   - Once the dataset is uploaded, Insight automatically generates a summary of the dataset. This includes:
     - **Title**: The name of the dataset.
     - **Brief Description**: A short summary or overview of the datasetâ€™s purpose or contents.
     - **Column Information**: Lists all the columns in the dataset along with their data types (e.g., numeric, categorical) and the total number of rows.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Insight runs a **data cleaning check** for each column to identify any issues like:
     - Missing values
     - Inconsistent formatting
     - And so more!
   - After identifying any problems, it provides **suggestions** on how to fix them (e.g., filling missing values with the mean, median, or removing rows with outliers).
   - Users can choose how theyâ€™d like to fix these issues, and the platform applies these changes to the dataset.

4. **Descriptive Data Analysis**:
   - The user can then select two columns from the dataset to perform a **descriptive analysis**. Insight provides detailed statistical insights such as:
     - Mean, median, and mode
     - Standard deviation
     - Correlations (if applicable)

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Using the **Pygwalker** library, users can select the columns they want to visualize and generate different types of **interactive visualizations**, such as:
     - Bar charts
     - Line graphs
     - Scatter plots
     - Histograms
   - These visualizations help users better understand patterns, distributions, and relationships in their data.

6. **Download the Cleaned Dataset**:
   - After applying the data cleaning steps, users have the option to **download** the updated and cleaned dataset, ready for further analysis or reporting.
